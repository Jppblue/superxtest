Estamos haciendo una app en react, usando supabase y nextjs Y tailwind.css, usaremos APP router.
Goal: search relevant X posts to get inspiration on what to write on a given topic.

**Todo:**

- Build a basic front end with an input field “search” and a CTA
- When pressing the button: search for relevant X post on the DB and display them
